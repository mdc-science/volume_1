# Assays for Determining Enzyme Activity {#chapter3}

## What is Enzymatic Activity?

Enzymes are specialized proteins that act as biological catalysts, accelerating chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. They are essential for life, enabling biochemical reactions to occur at rates compatible with biological processes. Biochemically, enzymes work by lowering the activation energy required for a chemical reaction to take place. They bind to substrates, which are the reactant molecules, forming an enzyme-substrate complex. After the reaction, the products are released, and the enzyme can be reused. Enzymes are highly specific, meaning each type of enzyme catalyzes a specific reaction or a set of similar reactions.

Enzymatic activity is expressed in various ways, depending on the measurement context. One of the most common methods is the reaction rate, which can be measured by the amount of product formed or the amount of substrate consumed per unit of time. Enzymatic activity is often expressed in units of activity (U), where one unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 micromole (µmol) of substrate per minute under specific pH and temperature conditions.

## Why Measure Enzymatic Activity?

Measuring enzymatic activity is a way to quantify the amount of an enzyme, offering an alternative to immunodetection analyses (e.g., ELISA and Western blot), which directly measure protein levels using antibodies. Enzymatic activity assays are an effective method for comparing enzyme levels between samples and are particularly useful when comparing different species, where epitope differences might interfere with immunodetection assays.

The values generated from an enzymatic assay, when performed correctly, are less prone to quantification issues compared to Western blot. In Western blot, quantification relies on image analysis methods that have many limitations. Additionally, while a Western blot experiment usually takes days to semi-quantitatively estimate protein levels, enzymatic assays can be completed in minutes and provide truly quantitative data. Enzymatic activity measurement also offers a level of reproducibility and the possibility of performing technical replicates that are not feasible with Western blot.

## Where is Enzymatic Activity Measured?

Enzymatic activity can be measured in various biological samples, each requiring specific preparation methods. Activity can be measured in tissue samples from plants and animals or in cultured cells. To prepare these samples, the tissue is typically homogenized in an appropriate buffer, often containing protease inhibitors to prevent enzymatic degradation. Homogenization is usually followed by centrifugation to remove cellular debris, resulting in a "clean" enzyme extract. Cell cultures, both bacterial and mammalian, are common sources for enzymatic measurements. The cells are harvested, washed, and lysed (usually by sonication, detergents, or repeated freezing and thawing) to release the enzymes. The cell lysate is then clarified by centrifugation to obtain the enzyme extract.

Each type of sample requires specific preparation to ensure that the measured enzymatic activity represents the in vivo activity. It is essential to optimize extraction and storage conditions to preserve enzyme integrity. Many enzymes are subject to post-translational modifications that can alter enzymatic kinetics without necessarily affecting the number of enzyme molecules. To ensure that enzymatic activity values represent the in vivo state of the enzymes, samples should be processed in a way that prevents post-translational modifications during tissue processing. For example, processing tissue at low temperatures and adding phosphatase and kinase inhibitors minimizes post-translational changes ex vivo.

## How is Enzymatic Activity Measured?

Most enzymatic assays are based on a reaction system where saturating levels of substrates are provided to the enzyme under optimal pH, osmolarity, and temperature conditions. Using this reaction medium, catalytic activity is measured by assessing the levels of substrate consumed or product generated, usually by colorimetric or fluorescence methods. In this way, the measured activity is the initial rate (v₀) and a reasonable approximation of Vmax. To make this approximation as close as possible to the true Vmax (calculated by performing enzymatic assays with various substrate concentrations and measuring the reaction rate at each concentration), it is necessary to understand the principle and limitations of each assay and perform appropriate control reactions for each method. These controls are usually referred to as "assay blanks" and "sample blanks" in a protocol.

A key factor to consider is ensuring that there is no enzymatic activity signal in the absence of the sample or that this "spontaneous" activity is adequately measured and subtracted during quantification. Additionally, using specific inhibitors can help diagnose specificity issues of the method concerning a particular enzyme.

Enzymatic activity assays can be performed either discontinuously or continuously. Discontinuous methods mix substrate and enzyme and measure the concentration of product formed (or substrate consumed) after a defined time, being quick and easy. In continuous assays, the appearance of the product (or the disappearance of the substrate) is constantly monitored over time. Enzymatic activity is influenced by pH and temperature, which must be constant during any enzymatic activity experiment. In continuous assays, the reaction rate is recorded immediately after adding the enzyme to the reaction medium, when the initial rate (v₀) is linear. By plotting absorbance data against time, the reaction rate (i.e., enzymatic activity) is calculated. The relationship between enzyme concentration and reaction rate is linear, meaning increasing the amount of enzyme by 10% accelerates the reaction by 10%, and doubling the concentration doubles the rate.

## Assumptions for Accurately Measuring Enzymatic Activity

To accurately measure enzymatic activity, several critical assumptions and conditions must be met to ensure reliable and reproducible results. These assumptions include the need for saturating substrate concentrations, proper enzyme stability, and controlled experimental conditions.

One fundamental assumption is that the substrate concentration must be saturating so that the initial reaction rate (v₀) approximates the maximum reaction rate (Vmax). This assumption ensures that the enzyme is working at its full catalytic potential, and the measured activity reflects the enzyme's true capacity. However, achieving saturating substrate concentrations can be challenging. In some cases, the substrate may not reach saturation at practical or viable concentration ranges due to solubility issues or potential interference with the assay's detection methods. Additionally, at high substrate concentrations, absorbance might be too high, leading to inaccuracies in optical measurements. In such situations, alternative methods such as using different detection techniques or modifying the assay conditions might be necessary.

Another important assumption is the stability of the enzyme during the assay. Enzymes are sensitive to various factors, including temperature, pH, and the presence of inhibitors or activators. It is crucial to maintain optimal and stable conditions throughout the assay to prevent enzyme denaturation or inactivation. The buffer system used should be appropriate for the enzyme's activity and stability, and the assay should be performed at a temperature that preserves enzyme function. Additionally, protease inhibitors may be required to protect the enzyme from degradation during the assay.

The assumption of linearity between enzyme concentration and reaction rate is essential for accurate quantification. This means that doubling the enzyme concentration should double the reaction rate, and this linear relationship should hold across a range of enzyme concentrations. To validate this assumption, preliminary experiments should be conducted to establish the linear range for the enzyme under the specific assay conditions. This ensures that the measurements fall within the linear portion of the enzyme's activity curve, avoiding saturation effects or substrate depletion that could lead to non-linear responses.

Accurate measurement of enzymatic activity also assumes that there are no interfering substances in the assay mixture that could affect the reaction rate. Substances such as other proteins, metal ions, or small molecules might inhibit or activate the enzyme or interfere with the detection method. Appropriate controls, including blanks and sample blanks, are necessary to account for background signals and non-enzymatic reactions. The use of specific inhibitors can help identify potential sources of non-specific activity and validate the specificity of the assay for the target enzyme.

The proper dilution of enzyme samples is another critical factor. Enzyme activity assays often require the enzyme to be diluted to a concentration that falls within the assay's detection range. The dilution factor must be determined experimentally to ensure that the enzyme concentration is neither too high, which could lead to substrate depletion, nor too low, which might result in undetectable activity. Serial dilutions and preliminary assays can help identify the optimal enzyme concentration for accurate measurements.

Finally, the reproducibility and reliability of enzymatic activity measurements depend on rigorous standardization of assay protocols. This includes consistent preparation of reagents, precise timing of reaction initiation and termination, and accurate calibration of detection instruments. Variations in any of these factors can introduce errors and affect the comparability of results across different experiments or laboratories.

In summary, accurately measuring enzymatic activity relies on several critical assumptions and conditions. These include ensuring saturating substrate concentrations, maintaining enzyme stability, verifying the linear relationship between enzyme concentration and reaction rate, accounting for potential interfering substances, determining the appropriate enzyme dilution, and standardizing assay protocols. Adhering to these principles is essential for obtaining reliable and reproducible enzymatic activity data.

### pH

Enzymes are sensitive to pH variations and have an optimum pH at which their catalytic activity is maximized. The relationship between enzymatic activity and pH is a bell-shaped curve, with the peak indicating the optimum pH. From the optimum pH, towards alkaline or acidic extremes, the activity of the enzyme decreases as the pH changes until it finally reaches zero at the extremes. This is because pH affects the ionization of charged groups involved in the catalytic mechanism and/or structural stability of the enzyme. Generally, enzymatic assays are conducted at physiological pH for the organism from which the sample originates. However, in some cases, it is convenient to use a pH that differs from the physiological for analytical reasons.

* **Temperature Control**: Like common chemical reactions, temperature significantly affects the speed of enzymatic reactions. For most enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the rate increases 2-3 times with every 10°C increase (temperature coefficient, Q~10~ = 2-3). That is, an increase in temperature within a specific range accelerates the reaction. To ensure the comparability of results from different samples and experimental days, readings should be made at the same temperature, preferably one that is physiologically relevant to the organism of origin (e.g., 37°C for human tissues). Microplate readers and spectrophotometers have temperature control systems for this purpose. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the deionized water used in the protocol at the assay temperature (e.g., using a water bath or dry block heaters). As most of the reaction medium volume is composed of water, ensuring the water is at the desired temperature helps stabilize the temperature of the reaction medium more quickly.

* **pH Control**: Enzymes are sensitive to pH variations and have an optimum pH at which their catalytic activity is maximized. The relationship between enzymatic activity and pH is a bell-shaped curve, with the peak indicating the optimum pH. From the optimum pH, towards alkaline or acidic extremes, the activity of the enzyme decreases as the pH changes until it finally reaches zero at the extremes. This is because pH affects the ionization of charged groups involved in the catalytic mechanism and/or structural stability of the enzyme. Generally, enzymatic assays are conducted at physiological pH for the organism from which the sample originates. However, in some cases, it is convenient to use a pH that differs from the physiological for analytical reasons.

* **Substrate Concentration**: Ideally, saturating concentrations of substrates and cofactors should always be used to determine an enzyme's activity (see [Chapter 4](#chapter4)). However, factors such as high molar absorptivity and low solubility prevent the assay from being conducted at such concentrations in most cases.

* **Initial Rate vs. V~max~**: Although some equipment expresses the initial change in absorbance over time (representing the change in substrate or product concentration) in an enzymatic assay as V~max~, this value is actually the initial rate (v~0~). Note that V~max~ is a theoretical limit never reached in any experiment, although it is possible to approach it and determine it by extrapolation. This limitation is caused by the fact that complete saturation can only be achieved at infinite concentrations of substrates and cofactors, and, despite using high concentrations of substrates and cofactors, the concentrations cannot be considered as completely saturating.

* **Enzyme Unit**: The enzyme unit, or international unit of enzymatic activity (U, sometimes IU), is a measure of an enzyme's catalytic activity. This unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of one µmol of substrate per minute (1 U = µmol/min), under conditions specified by the assay method.

* **Expression of Enzymatic Activity**: Measures of enzymatic activity are often expressed as units per milligram of protein (U/mg protein), both in cell lysates or tissue homogenates and in isolated protein preparations. This practice is based on the need to normalize enzymatic activity relative to the amount of protein present in the sample, providing a standardized way to compare enzymatic activity between different samples and experiments.
