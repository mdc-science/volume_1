Problem,Possible Cause,Solution
Inconsistent results between runs,Pipetting errors,Calibrate pipettes and ensure consistent technique
,Temperature variations,Maintain a consistent temperature environment during the experiment
,Inconsistent incubation times,Standardize and carefully monitor incubation times
No change in absorbance over time,Incorrect wavelength selected,Verify and set the correct wavelength
,Sample not added,Ensure the sample is correctly pipetted into the wells
High initial absorbance,,
Low initial absorbance,,
Non-linear rate,,
