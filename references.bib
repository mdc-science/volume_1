	abstract = {Catalase exerts a dual function: (1) decomposition of H2O2 to give H2O and O2 (catalytic activity) and (2) oxidation of H donors, for example, methanol, ethanol, formic acid, phenols, with the consumption of 1 mol of peroxide (peroxide activity). The kinetics of catalase does not obey the normal pattern. Measurements of enzyme activity at substrate saturation or determination of the Ks is therefore impossible. In contrast to reactions proceeding at substrate saturation, the enzymic decomposition of H2O2 is a first-order reaction, the rate of which is always proportional to the peroxide concentration present. Consequently, to avoid a rapid decrease in the initial rate of the reaction, the assay must be carried out with relatively low concentrations of H2O2 (about 0.01 M). This chapter discusses the catalytic activity of catalase. The method of choice for biological material, however, is ultraviolet ({UV}) spectrophotometry. Titrimetric methods are suitable for comparative studies. For large series of measurements, there are either simple screening tests, which give a quick indication of the approximative catalase activity, or automated methods.},

	abstract = {The effects of in vivo inhibition of catalase by 3-amino 1,2,4-triazole ({AMT}) on the levels of damage products resulting from reactive oxygen species attack on proteins and lipids as well as on the activities of five antioxidant and associated enzymes were studied in the brain of goldfish, Carassius auratus. Intraperitoneal injection of {AMT} at a concentration of 0.1 mg/g wet weight caused a gradual decrease in brain catalase activity over 72 h, whereas higher {AMT} concentrations (0.5 or 1.0 mg/g) reduced catalase activity by about two-thirds within 5–10 h. {AMT} effects on antioxidant enzyme activities and oxidative stress markers were studied in detail using fish treated with 0.5 mg/g {AMT} for 24 or 168 h. The levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (a lipid damage product) increased 6.5-fold by 24 h after {AMT} injection but fell again after 168 h. The content of carbonylproteins ({CP}) also rose within 24 h (by ∼2-fold) and remained 1.5-fold higher compared with respective sham-injected fish after 168 h. {CP} levels correlated inversely with catalase activity (R2 = 0.83) suggesting that catalase may protect proteins in vivo against oxidative modification. The activities of both glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase increased by ∼50\% and 80\%, respectively, in brain of {AMT}-treated fish and this might represent a compensatory response to lowered catalase activity. Possible functions of catalase in the maintenance of prooxidant/antioxidant balance in goldfish brain are discussed.},
