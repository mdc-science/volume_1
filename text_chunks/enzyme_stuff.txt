* **Temperature Control**: Like common chemical reactions, temperature significantly affects the speed of enzymatic reactions. For most enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the rate increases 2-3 times with every 10°C increase (temperature coefficient, Q~10~ = 2-3). That is, an increase in temperature within a specific range accelerates the reaction. To ensure the comparability of results from different samples and experimental days, readings should be made at the same temperature, preferably one that is physiologically relevant to the organism of origin (e.g., 37°C for human tissues). Microplate readers and spectrophotometers have temperature control systems for this purpose. Additionally, it is recommended to keep the deionized water used in the protocol at the assay temperature (e.g., using a water bath or dry block heaters). As most of the reaction medium volume is composed of water, ensuring the water is at the correct temperature helps stabilize the temperature of the reaction medium more quickly.

* **pH Control**: Enzymes are sensitive to pH variations and have an optimum pH at which their catalytic activity is maximized. The relationship between enzymatic activity and pH is a bell-shaped curve, with the peak indicating the optimum pH. From the optimum pH, towards alkaline or acidic extremes, the activity of the enzyme decreases as the pH changes until it finally reaches zero at the extremes. This is because pH affects the ionization of charged groups involved in the catalytic mechanism and/or structural stability of the enzyme. Generally, enzymatic assays are conducted at physiological pH for the organism from which the sample originates. However, in some cases, it is convenient to use a pH that differs from the physiological for analytical reasons.

* **Substrate Concentration**: Ideally, saturating concentrations of substrates and cofactors should always be used to determine an enzyme's activity. However, factors such as high molar absorptivity and low solubility prevent the assay from being conducted at such concentrations in most cases.

* **Initial Rate vs. V~max~**: Although some equipment expresses the initial change in absorbance over time (representing the change in substrate or product concentration) in an enzymatic assay as V~max~, this value is actually the initial rate (v~0~). Note that V~max~ is a theoretical limit never reached in any experiment, although it is possible to approach it and determine it by extrapolation. This limitation is caused by the fact that complete saturation can only be achieved at infinite concentrations of substrates and cofactors, and, despite using high concentrations of substrates and cofactors, the concentrations cannot be considered as completely saturating.

* **Enzyme Unit**: The enzyme unit, or international unit of enzymatic activity (U, sometimes IU), is a measure of an enzyme's catalytic activity. This unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of one µmol of substrate per minute (1 U = µmol/min), under conditions specified by the assay method.

* **Expression of Enzymatic Activity**: Measures of enzymatic activity are often expressed as units per milligram of protein (U/mg protein), both in cell lysates or tissue homogenates and in isolated protein preparations. This practice is based on the need to normalize enzymatic activity relative to the amount of protein present in the sample, providing a standardized way to compare enzymatic activity between different samples and experiments.
