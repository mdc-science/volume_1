For this protocol, samples must be homogenized in a way that proteins remain in their native conformations. That is, the homogenate should not have been prepared with high concentrations of detergents or salts, in the presence of chaotropic agents, subjected to heating, or deproteinized. Additionally, the homogenate should be prepared at low temperature and in a buffer containing EDTA and protease inhibitors (see protocol **SP.001**).
