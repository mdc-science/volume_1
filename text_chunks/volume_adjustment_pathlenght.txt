* **Volume Adjustments and Optical Path Length**: The final volume and the volumes of reagents can be adjusted for stock solutions of different concentrations and reading containers of different volumes, such as cuvettes or microplates, provided that the final concentrations are maintained as specified in the protocol. It is crucial to adjust the obtained signal for an optical path length of 1 cm, as the molar coefficient indicated in the protocol is in cm^-1^. This means that if a reading container with a different optical path length is used, the absorbance value should be multiplied by the ratio between 1 cm and the new path length, ensuring the correct adjustment of the measured signal. For example, if the optical path is 0.5 cm, the measured absorbance should be multiplied by 2.
